# Milestone-2-Project-The-Movie-Gallery

The Movie Gallery project offers the opportunity for anyone to add and edit movies in their collection. 

This app was designed with the user in mind. We made a point to focus on making the app visually pleasing with a smooth transition from one screen to the next. Our ultimate goal is to maintain optimal backend functionality that translates to a seamless front-end. 

This project is designed as a MERN (MongoDb Express React Node) full-stack application that implements full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality.

## Tech Usage
CSS Framework: Bootstrap

Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS

Server-Side Rendering: JSX

Node Modules: method-override, dotenv, express-react-views
